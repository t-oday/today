        bombarded with flyers of biblical-philological content and an embarrassing amount of interest by a pious preacher,

      <p class="normal">
        close friends begin to touch themselves amid a conversation about what touches them; the cucked Christian holds a beautiful oil painting showing the boy&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s likeness, a red gauze cloth hanging atop his downward-looking face, over the head of the real boy.
        <br>
        Meanwhile, he&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s standing behind a beer table on top of which she lies on her back, both fully undressed and masturbating in close proximity but with no point of contact

        his hunt for the jerk who keeps sending their dishes back leads Uwe to my poking-a-halved-risotto-stuffed-quince-with-the-brass-cutlery self. shame he looks like a boiled egg. we punch in the face.

        busboy picking at his Homicidal Liu acne scars. i tip him one million, we punch in the face.

        the secret sixth petal of Ocean Flower Resort i use as a junk drawer: my stun grenades, my curdling micellar vinaigrettes, but Uwe&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s own murdering combos. please, he hates me to a reasonable extent.

        Fate&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s grasping tightly while I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m hard right next to you

      <p class="normal">
        In every tint of green, smirking with a golden hue
        <br>
        I don&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t know if it&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s fated or if I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m just faded
        <br>
        Maybe it&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s both cuz I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m retarded too
        <br>
        The sun now sets its orange cast
        <br>
        So I counted every shadow of the future found in each n every past
        <br>
        Got a burn from being in the sun too long
        <br>
        And another burn from Nairing till my dysphoria&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s gone
        <br>
        Thinking about how I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m all the cis bitches favorite, but it sucks to suck cuz they don&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t even have the balls to say it

        aging war criminal dream, inflected oscillating. delirium–tedium, POV–documentary, sometimes i&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m watching the guy getting morphine and sometimes i&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m the guy, morphine&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.

        his hands are freckled and wispy thin-skinned, jagged knee bones visible through pants. spiritual inverse of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8216;dick print&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, but i&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ve forgotten the crime(s) anyway so who gives a fuck. phone password is a numerical palindrome. writing a note about unhappy couples reifying joint hallucinations to feign intimacy. woman sees a little green man in every doorknob she touches. man takes it a step further, says it&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s their baby.

        A man grabs me from behind while I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m peeing at the urinal.

      <p class="normal">
        And I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m turning my head and looking at him and saying what are you doing but I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m still peeing. And he&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s just standing there frozen. Chris Brown is playing over the speakers.

        While you were suffering from a severe severe fever you asked me to bring you a bowl of melted snow. We lived together in a small village on a mountain. And. You always worked so hard for me.
